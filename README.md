## Getting Started

### How To SetUp

To get started with the project, use commands given in this repository and install the dependencies:

```
$ npm i puppeteer
```


## Puppeteer
Puppeteer -> a high level module made by google that can do most of the automation that could be done manually
to launch a browser -> function defined -> browser context
tabs -> pages
keyboard/mouse/screenTouch clicks
upload/download
iFrames
Worker -> can do parallel works -> eg. submitting a code and clicking anywhere on website ->(generally js allows single run only)
