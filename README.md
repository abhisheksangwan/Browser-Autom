## Getting Started

### How To SetUp

To get started with the project, use commands given in this repository and install the dependencies:

```
$ npm i puppeteer
```


## Puppeteer
Puppeteer -> a high level module made by google that can do most of the automation that could be done manually<br>
to launch a browser -> function defined -> browser context<br>
tabs -> pages <br>
keyboard/mouse/screenTouch clicks <br>
upload/download <br>
iFrames <br>
Worker -> can do parallel works -> eg. submitting a code and clicking anywhere on website ->(generally js allows single run only) <br>
